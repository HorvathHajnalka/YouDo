# YouDo Android Task Manager

Hello!ðŸ˜Š Thanks for checking out YouDo, my very first full-stack programme. It started as a hobby project, but as I added features, it grew into something I'm really proud of and I have many ideas for making YouDo even better. It's a simple yet powerful app I created to help manage daily tasks. My goal was to make something that's not just easy to use but also packs in enough features to actually be useful in keeping up with day-to-day activities.
## Features

YouDo is packed with features to help you manage your day better:

- **Authentication:** Includes features for Registration, Login, and Google Sign In. 
- **Google APIs (Calendar Integration):** You can upload, edit, and delete your tasks directly on your Google Calendar via this app.
- **Step Counter (Sensor Usage):** Stay healthy while being productive. Using your phone's sensors, step counter works in the background (even when the app is closed), monitored through a persistent notification for easy access.
- **Date-Based Filtering:** Easily sort and view your tasks/steps based on deadlines and dates, allowing for efficient time management.
- **User Interface:** Intuitive and user-friendly interface for seamless navigation and task management.
- **Backend System:** A robust system combining SQLite and Firebase, offering a secure and reliable database for your tasks and personal data.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Tested and fully functional on Android 13 and 14, providing smooth user experience across devices.

## Security Note

For security reasons, a few files crucial to the operation of this project are not available in the repository. This measure ensures the integrity and security of the YouDo app, as it contains sensitive information and proprietary code essential for its functionality.

## Development Philosophy

YouDo is a passion project developed with the aim of providing users a smooth task managing experience. As such, this project is not open for external development contributions. However, your feedback and suggestions are always welcome, as they can inspire future updates and enhancements.

## Future Plans

There are many exciting new features and improvements I plan to implement, including expanding services with Google APIs, analyzing step counter data and making reports, developing compatibility with other Android versions, and enriching the todo functionalities.


## Getting Started

To use YouDo in your development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Discuss security files with the owner:** Before proceeding, ensure to coordinate with the project owner regarding the necessary security files. These are crucial for the application's operation and without them, running the program cannot be guaranteed.
